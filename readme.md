# Find My Example

This will try and find examples of the use of a library and function you want to use.

For example, you are about to code in **python** and you are about to use **boto3**
and you want to talk to **s3** then this system would find that using a basic command like.

```
find-my-example --lang python --library boto3 --class s3 --function buckets.all
```

The `--class` and `--function` are optional or you could just say `buckets` or you can say `s3`

Then it would scan a searchable system of data. This searchable system had ahead of time gathered this data from sources like **github**. **bitbucket** or **gitlabs**.
